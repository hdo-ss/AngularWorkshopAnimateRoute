Angular Workshop: Animation and Routes
================
Welcome to the second Angular workshop! Missed the first one?  Check it out [here](https://github.com/hdo-ss/AngularWorkshop1).

## Description
For your workshop, you will use the following features of angular:
- ngRoute
- ngAnimate
Each of these can be found via the AngularJS documentation

Each developer will create:
 - A Controller JS file
 - A View
 - A CSS file

In each page, you must create a navigation system that introduces pieces about
yourself. An example:
 - About link: A page about yourself.
 - Favorite Foods link: Your favorite food, as a list.
 - Your Favorite Websites: Links to your favorite websites.

### Routing
Your page must be included as a part of angular config,
where you will set up your routes (much like a symfony routing yml).

You must also create routes for your sub pages.

### Animation
You will also create animations for each of your page transition.

Each animation must be different from someone else.


### BONUS POINTS!
With the nested routing above, create a template that can be used as a partial
inside your page.  In other words: when you click your nav links, it should
fill a nested DOM element with a sub-partial template.


Happy Coding!
